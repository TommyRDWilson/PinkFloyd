                  <p>Album sleeve designers Hipgnosis arranged a three-day photo shoot at London's Battersea Power Station. With a concept suggested by Roger Waters, the team photographed a 40ft helium-filled inflatable pig floating above the power station for the cover of the new Floyd album, Animals. On the first day, the marksman who had been hired to shoot down the pig if it escaped its mooring ropes was not needed, but it took so long to inflate the pig that the photographers could only get coverage of the building. On the second day the pig was installed but broke free and sailed away; the marksman hadn't been rehired so it escaped, coming down in Kent. On the third day, Hipgnosis got their shot, but the final cover was a composite of Day 3 pig and Day 1 location.</p>
