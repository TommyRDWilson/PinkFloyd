                  Animals is the tenth studio album by Pink Floyd.
                  It was first released on 23 January 1977 by Harvest Records in the United Kingdom and by Columbia Records in the United States.
                  It is a concept album that provides a scathing critique of the social-political conditions of late 1970s Britain, and presents a marked change in musical style from earlier work.
                  The album's cover image, a pig floating between two chimneys of the Battersea Power Station, was conceived by the band's bassist and lead songwriter Roger Waters, and was designed by long-time collaborator Storm Thorgerson.
