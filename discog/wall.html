                  The Wall is the eleventh studio album by Pink Floyd.
                  It was released as a double album on 30 November 1979 in the United Kingdom by Harvest Records and in the United States by Columbia Records.
                  Roger Waters conceived the album as a rock opera during Pink Floyd's 1977 In the Flesh Tour.
                  Its story explores Pink, a jaded rockstar character that Waters modeled after himself and the band's original leader Syd Barrett.
                  Pink's life begins with the loss of his father during the Second World War and continues with abuse from his schoolteachers, an overprotective mother, and the breakdown of his marriage; all contribute to his eventual self-imposed isolation from society, symbolised by a wall.
