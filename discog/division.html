                  The Division Bell is the fourteenth studio album by Pink Floyd, released on 28 March 1994 by EMI Records in the United Kingdom and on 4 April by Columbia Records in the United States.
                  The Division Bell was written mostly by guitarist and singer David Gilmour and keyboardist Richard Wright; it features Wright's first lead vocal on a Pink Floyd album since The Dark Side of the Moon (1973).
                  Novelist Polly Samson co-wrote many of the lyrics, which deal with themes of communication.
                  Recording took place in locations including the band's Britannia Row Studios and Gilmour's houseboat, Astoria.
                  The production team included longtime Pink Floyd collaborators such as producer Bob Ezrin, engineer Andy Jackson, saxophonist Dick Parry, and bassist Guy Pratt.
