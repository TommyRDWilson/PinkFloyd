                  A Saucerful of Secrets is the second studio album by Pink Floyd, released on 29 June 1968 by EMI Columbia in the United Kingdom and released on 27 July 1968 in the United States by Tower Records.
                  The album was recorded before and after Syd Barrett's departure from the group. With Barrett's behaviour becoming increasingly unpredictable, he was forced to leave the band and David Gilmour was recruited in January 1968.
                  As a result, A Saucerful of Secrets is the only non-compilation Pink Floyd album on which all five band members appeared, the first for Gilmour, with him appearing on six songs (all except "Jugband Blues"), and the last for Barrett, with him on three ("Remember a Day", "Jugband Blues" and "Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun").
                  Despite the reference that Gilmour had appeared on six songs, it is actually only five because he was not present on Wright's "Remember a Day" that Barrett played on (the song was recorded in October 1967 before Gilmour was asked to join the band as a fifth member).
                  "Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun" was the only song all five members appeared on together.
                  Nick Mason, has declared A Saucerful of Secrets to be his favourite Pink Floyd album.
