                  The Endless River is the fifteenth studio album by Pink Floyd, released in November 2014 by Parlophone Records in the United Kingdom and Columbia Records in the United States.
                  It is the first Pink Floyd album following the death of keyboardist Rick Wright in 2008, who appears posthumously.
                  The Endless River comprises instrumental and ambient music based on material recorded during the Division Bell sessions, with new material recorded in 2013 and 2014 on Gilmour's Astoria boat studio and in Medina Studios in Hove, England. It was produced by David Gilmour, Youth, Andy Jackson and Phil Manzanera. Only one track has lead vocals, "Louder than Words". After the death of longtime Pink Floyd artist Storm Thorgerson in 2013, the cover was created by artist Ahmed Emad Eldin, design company Stylorouge, and Aubrey Powell, co-founder of Thorgeson's design company Hipgnosis.
                  The Endless River was promoted with the "Louder than Words" single and artwork installations in cities including London, New York, Paris, Berlin, and Milan.
                  It became the most pre-ordered album of all time on Amazon UK, and debuted at number one in several countries.
