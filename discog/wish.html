                  Wish You Were Here is the ninth studio album by Pink Floyd.
                  It was released on 12 September 1975 in the United Kingdom by Harvest Records and a day later in the United States by Columbia Records.
                  Based on material Pink Floyd composed while performing in Europe, Wish You Were Here was recorded over numerous sessions at Abbey Road Studios in London.
                  Two songs criticise the music business, another expresses alienation and the multi-part composition "Shine On You Crazy Diamond" is a tribute to Pink Floyd founder Syd Barrett.
                  As with their album The Dark Side of the Moon (1973), Floyd used studio effects, synthesizers and brought in guest singers, Roy Harper, who provided the lead vocals on "Have a Cigar" and Venetta Fields, who added backing vocals to "Shine On You Crazy Diamond".
