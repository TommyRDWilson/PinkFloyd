                  More (released in the United States as Original Motion Picture Soundtrack from the film More) is the first soundtrack album and third studio album by Pink Floyd.
                  It was released on 13 June 1969 in the United Kingdom by EMI Columbia and on 9 August 1969 in the United States by Tower Records.
                  It was the band's first album without any involvement from former band leader Syd Barrett, and is a soundtrack for the 1969 film of the same name, which was primarily filmed on location on Ibiza and was the directorial debut of Barbet Schroeder.

                  More is a psychedelic rock soundtrack album which contains some acoustic folk ballads, a genre that appeared sparsely on Pink Floyd's later works.
                  It also contains some of the band's "heaviest" recordings, such as "The Nile Song" and "Ibiza Bar", as well as several instrumental tracks, featuring their experimental and avant-garde approach.
