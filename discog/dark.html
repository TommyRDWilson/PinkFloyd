                  The Dark Side of the Moon is the eighth studio album by Pink Floyd, released on 1 March 1973 by Harvest Records.
                  It built on ideas explored in Pink Floyd's earlier recordings and performances, but without the extended instrumentals that characterised their earlier work.
                  A concept album, its themes explore conflict, greed, time, and mental illness, the latter partly inspired by the deteriorating health of founding member Syd Barrett, who left in 1968.
                  Developed during live performances, Pink Floyd premiered an early version of The Dark Side of the Moon several months before recording began.
                  New material was recorded in two sessions in 1972 and 1973 at Abbey Road Studios in London. The group used advanced recording techniques at the time, including multitrack recording and tape loops; analogue synthesizers are prominent, and snippets from interviews with Pink Floyd's road crew and others provide philosophical quotations.
                  Engineer Alan Parsons was responsible for many sonic aspects and the recruitment of singer Clare Torry, who appears on "The Great Gig in the Sky".
                  The iconic sleeve was designed by Storm Thorgerson; following keyboardist Richard Wright's request for a "simple and bold" design, it depicts a prism spectrum, representing the band's lighting and the record's themes.
                  With estimated sales of over 45 million copies, it is Pink Floyd's bestselling album and one of the best-selling albums worldwide.
