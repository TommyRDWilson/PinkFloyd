                  Obscured by Clouds is the seventh studio album by Pink Floyd, based on their soundtrack for the French film La Vallée, by Barbet Schroeder.
                  It was released in the United Kingdom on 2 June 1972, and a few weeks later in the United States, by Harvest Records.
                  By 1972, Pink Floyd had recorded the soundtracks to the films The Committee (1968) and More (1969), and to part of Zabriskie Point (1970).
                  On the back of More's success, its director Barbet Schroeder asked the band to record the soundtrack of his next major project as and when it arrived.
                  The new film, La Vallée, featured two travellers on a spiritual quest in New Guinea, and Schroeder thought Pink Floyd would be suitable to provide the music.
